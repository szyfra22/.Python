# # Exercise 8 
# Make a two-player Rock-Paper-Scissors game. (Hint: Ask for player plays (using input), compare them, print out a message of congratulations to the winner, and ask if the players want to start a new game)

# 
# Rock beats scissors
# Scissors beats paper
# Paper beats rock

#to stop a game:
stop = False
